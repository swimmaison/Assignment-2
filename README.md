## Responsive Portfolio

Responsive design ensures that web applications render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. As a developer, you will likely be asked to create a mobile-first application or add responsive design to an existing application.
Using the Bootstrap CSS Framework I created a mobile responsive portfolio that contains:

#Navbar
#Semantic HTML
#Working Links
#Responsive layout
#Responsive images
#Home/About Page, Contact Page, Portfolio Page
#Proper utilization of Bootstrap components and grid system
#Sticky footer and use of sub-rows and sub-columns
