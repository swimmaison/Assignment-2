## Description: 
Responsive design ensures that web applications render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. As a developer, you will likely be asked to create a mobile-first application or add responsive design to an existing application.
Using the Bootstrap CSS Framework I created a mobile responsive portfolio that contains:

* Navbar
* Semantic HTML
* Working Links
* Responsive layout
* Responsive images
* Home/About Page, Contact Page, Portfolio Page
* Proper utilization of Bootstrap components and grid system
* Sticky footer and use of sub-rows and sub-columns
